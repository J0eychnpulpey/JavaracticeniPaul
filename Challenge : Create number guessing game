/*Challenge : Create number guessing game

Core Logic:
Secret Number: The computer generates a random number.
Loop: The player has a set number of attempts to guess the number.
Feedback (Conditional Branches): After each guess:
If correct: Celebrate and exit the loop.
If too high: Tell the player to guess lower.
If too low: Tell the player to guess higher.
Exit After Attempts (Optional): Use a break to exit the loop if the player runs out of tries

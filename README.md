# Java-ractice of Paul (JVROP)
Practicing Java programming feels like a small win for me, even though it can be frustrating and overwhelming at first. Every time I learn something new, I realize there's so much more to discover, which can sometimes lead to imposter syndrome. But I choose to embrace this feeling and see it as a motivator to keep learning and growing.
